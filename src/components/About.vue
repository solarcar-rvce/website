        <p class="about-div-parah">The RVCE Solar Car Team, Bangalore, is among the most advanced, dynamic and publicised solar initiatives in India. A Solar Car, a Solar Challenge, 3000 km, 5 days and one goal- the finish line. The team consists of an eclectic mix of 30 students from R.V. College of Engineering (RVCE) pursuing their Bachelors of Engineering in various fields like Mechanical, Electronics, Electrical, Computer Science, Chemical, Industrial and Biotech engineering.<br><br> The team was established in 2013, with an objective to primarily help promote the use of solar technology as well as inspire the younger generations to think green. The team represented India in the World Solar Challenge twice.</p>

            <p class="about-p">To promote the use of our most important natural resource, the Sun! With this in mind, we work to inspire young minds and make a humble effort to promote the research and development of emerging solar technologies.<br><br>Our aim is to build a highly efficient solar powered electric vehicle, incorporating the latest technological advances in the field of solar energy and also the automotive industry, and try to make practical solar cars available and viable to the public.<br><br>The project is an interdisciplinary project and thus comprises of multiple dimensions. Starting from the smallest sensors that go into the car to the latest lithium ion battery technology and silicon solar panels used, there exists an innovation at every stage, and is a step towards a future of green and sustainable transport.</p>

            <p class="vision-p">To continuously strive to make sustainable transportation commercially viable, by promoting research and development of energy efficient solar electric vehicles and the use of solar energy in everyday life. We conduct various public events including exhibitions, expos, workshops in schools and colleges, events in colleges, corporate events and roadshows<br><br>Since non-renewable sources of energy are rapidly decreasing, utilizing the renewable energy sources efficiently has become the need of the hour. We believe that the Sun, the most abundant renewable energy source, is the future of the energy sector. Millions of dollars are being invested on solar installations and research in solar technology. This project is a humble attempt from our side to contribute to the current situation.</p>
