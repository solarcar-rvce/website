                <p class="content-wsc-p">Our prime event is the prestigious Bridgestone World Solar Challenge where we will be up against some of the most reputed universities across the globe. We also take pride in the fact that we were the only Indian team to participate in the World Solar Challenge 2015 and 2017. <br><br>The World Solar Challenge is a biennial event held in Australia. The race challenges the teams to cover 3,022 kilometres (from Darwin to Adelaide) in 7 days running solely on solar energy across the Australian Outback.<br><br>Top universities like MIT, Stanford, Michigan, Tokai, TU Delft and many more compete here therefore finishing the race is in itself a huge accomplishment. We also aim at participating in many other international solar car racing events like the Sasol Solar Challenge.</p>
